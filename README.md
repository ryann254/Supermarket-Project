# Supermarket-Project
# Info:

This project registers new customers visiting a supermarket for the first time and saves their details in an external txt file[users.db].
It also welcomes already registered customers and checks to see whether its they are really registered.
Registered customers will have their accumulated points saved up and can use them at their own discretion.

Once a new user registers they're asked whether they hace a personal bag if true, the bag is stored in a compartment 
and the compartment number is stored in another external txt file[available.txt].
The amount the customer has shopped is generated randomly.

# Options
If its the customer's birthday, the customer gets a special discount, the customer can also choose to redeem his/her points and finally
the customer also gets a special discount if they use the cashless payment method[paying through mpesa/visa].
Lastily a receipt is printed with the total amount that customer has spent and if its his/her birthday, a birthday message is printed on
the receipt.
